### Note: This is only the core (without the core plugins you need)
This is only the core for forking (like Linux). 

- The FULL "WhiteLabelPress V2 fork" is available at <a href="https://github.com/wlp-builders/whitelabelpress-wlp">wlp-builders/whitelabelpress-wlp</a>.
- If you want to start your own fork, you can do so very easily. See <a href="https://github.com/wlp-builders/whitelabelpress-wlp">wlp-builders/whitelabelpress-wlp</a> as an example. You essentially just need to create your own core plugins folder.
