### Note this is only the core (without the core plugins you need)
This is only the core for forking (like Linux). 

- The FULL "WhiteLabelPress V2 fork" is at <a href="https://github.com/wlp-builders/whitelabelpress-wlp">wlp-builders/whitelabelpress-wlp</a>
- If you want to start your own fork, you can, very easily. Also see <a href="https://github.com/wlp-builders/whitelabelpress-wlp">wlp-builders/whitelabelpress-wlp</a> as example. You basically just create your own core plugins folder.

## What is WhiteLabelpress?
WhiteLabelpress intents to decentralize plugin upgrades and more protection against any trademark claims while still **supporting major WordPress / WLP plugins**.
